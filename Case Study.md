## Context

In the rapidly evolving automotive industry, online platforms have become pivotal in driving sales and customer engagement. For this case study, you will analyze data from different car sales platforms operated by the same car company in a single market.

## Objectives

Your task is to analyze the datasets provided and extract actionable insights that can help the company optimize its sales strategy across different platforms.

### Task 1: Data Analysis

Using the provided datasets, please perform the following analyses:

1. Describe the datasets and the eventual anomalies you find.
2. Which patterns do you find in the purchasing behavior of the customers?
3. Conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the datasets.
4. Perform customer segmentation to cluster users based on their interactions and purchasing behaviors on the different platforms.
5. Investigate the types of cars (e.g., electric, hybrid, diesel) preferred on each platform and how this correlates with the platform's sales performance and user satisfaction.
6. (optional) Open-ended exploration: you can explore the datasets further and propose additional analyses, modeling, visualizations, or insights.




### Task 2: Presentation

You are the lead eCommerce Data Scientist in a well-known car company, and this task requires you to come up with ideas for the following digitalization problem: <br>
Online sales have dominated the used car market for years, and it makes sense for this trend also to invade the new car scene. Consequently, your company wants to increase the share of its online sales from its total new car sales as well. 

Now, it is your job to develop ideas that revolve around using big data and data science within eCommerce to boost online sales.


1. Use your findings from Task 1 to provide strategic recommendations for each platform, focusing on aspects such as user experience and marketing strategies.

2. Develop ideas that focus on data science and machine learning to enhance the digital customer journey on our website and how would you reduce unnesarry user journey.


Prepare a 20-25 minute presentation of your findings, dedicating  ~20 minutes to Task 1 and ~5 minutes for Task 2.

Feel free to use any presentation software you are comfortable with.
